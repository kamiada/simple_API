# API in Flask + Python

In order to run file: 
```
python api.py

```
or : 
```
python api2.py
```
API was build through following tutorial in order to understand better REST APIs and to code something in Python. 

## Conclussion

So what I learn is that Flask allows to map HTTP requests to Python functions, therefore is useful for creating APIs and dealing with Databases thanks to SQLite extension. 

Regarding APIs - I learned more how they work (user interface but for software instead of users), when to build them and what exactly it is REST. And REST is philosophy of creating APIs. Following HTTP protocols, how URLs suppose to look like, to insert query parameters (and hash them for safety if it's a private API), etc. 

I also learn that tabs issues in Python are like curly braces in every other language. But I guess practice helps with that as well.
